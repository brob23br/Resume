AWS Deployment

Deploy your resume to AWS using the included CloudFormation template for global CDN distribution.

Prerequisites

Domain name (optional, for custom domain setup)
SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (for HTTPS)
Deployment Steps

Prepare the CloudFormation template:

# Edit the template file to replace placeholder values
# Update variables like ${PRIMARY_DOMAIN}, ${SITE_BUCKET_NAME}, etc.


Deploy the stack:

aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name resume-website \
  --template-body file://ResumeCDN-template-1755952606570.yaml \
  --parameters ParameterKey=DomainName,ParameterValue=yourdomain.com


Upload your files to S3:

# Replace 'your-bucket-name' with your actual S3 bucket name
aws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name/ \
  --exclude "*.yaml" \
  --exclude "*.md" \
  --exclude ".git/*"


Access your resume:

Via CloudFront distribution URL
Via your custom domain (if configured)
CloudFormation Resources

The template creates:

S3 Bucket: Static website hosting
CloudFront Distribution: Global CDN with HTTPS
Origin Access Control: Secure S3 access
Route53 Records: DNS configuration (if using custom domain)
Cache Policies: Optimized caching behavior
