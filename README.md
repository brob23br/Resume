## üéì Study Tips

### Effective Lab Usage
1. **Read objectives first** to understand learning goals
2. **Follow both Console and CLI approaches** for complete understanding
3. **Take notes** on key concepts and commands
4. **Practice variations** of the lab scenarios
5. **Review AWS documentation** links provided

### Exam Preparation Strategy
1. Complete labs in sequence for building knowledge
2. Focus extra time on Lambda-heavy labs (Labs 1, 2, 8, 9)
3. Understand security implications in each lab
4. Practice deployment and troubleshooting scenarios
5. Review all CLI commands and their parameters

### Time Management
- **Budget 2-4 hours per lab** depending on complexity

- Check credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
- Ensure proper region configuration: `aws configure list`

**Console access issues:**
- Verify AWS account permissions
- Check service availability in your region
- Review IAM policies for required permissions

**Cost concerns:**
- Always follow cleanup instructions completely
- Set up billing alerts in AWS console
